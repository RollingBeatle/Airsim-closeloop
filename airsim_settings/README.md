# Airsim settings files

We are saving the different Airsim settings configurations to easily change.

- ```settings_UE4.json``` is the settings file used in the UE4 simulation shown in the video, it has a bottom facing camera with a model able to take pictures
- ```setings_UE5_lidar.json``` is the settings file used in the new UE5 environment that allows for the use of LiDAR and camera for sensor fusion
- ```settings_UE5_tracking.json``` is the settings file used in UE5 for tracking a point to land
- ```settings.json``` main version being tested 

When using either of them please place them in your ```~/User/Documents/Airsim``` folder and change the name for simply ```settings.json```
