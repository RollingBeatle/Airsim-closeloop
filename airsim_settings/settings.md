# Airsim settings files

- ```settings_UE4.json``` is the settings file used in the UE4 simulation shown in the video, it has a bottom facing camera with a model able to take pictures
- ```setings_UE5.json``` is the settings file used in the new UE5 environment that allows for the use of LiDAR and camera for sensor fusion

When using either of them please place them in your ```~/User/Documents/Airsim``` folder and change the name for simply ```settings.json```
