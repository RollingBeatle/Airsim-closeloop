Analysis of candidates:

- Image 0: Large, uniform, tiled surface that appears flat. No visible obstructions, no people, and no nearby edges are apparent. Texture seams between tiles don’t pose a hazard. Best option.

"Assessment: The rooftop appears flat and structurally uniform with a parapet around the edges. The marked green spot is in an open central area, away from the roof edge. There are HVAC units, ducts, and vents on the roof, but none directly under or immediately adjacent to the marked point. No people or vehicles are present. The nearest obstructions (ductwork and vent clusters) are several meters away, providing adequate clearance for descent and rotor wash. There are no visible slopes, gaps, or debris at the selected point. Recommendation: Proceed with final approach to the marked spot while maintaining a cautious buffer from the nearby HVAC equipment and avoiding exhaust plumes.",
"Assessment: The selected rooftop area appears to be a flat, open gravel ballast surface bounded by parapet walls. Within the interior there are no visible obstructions such as vents, ducts, units, or debris piles, and no people are present. The surface looks level and provides a reasonably large clear zone if the touchdown point is kept well away from the parapet edges. Adjacent streets and other rooftops do not encroach on the landing area. Note: loose gravel can be stirred by rotor washâ€”aim for a gentle vertical descent and land near the center to maintain margin from the parapet walls. Decision: Suitable for final approach.",
"The surface appears to be a uniform, flat plane with no visible obstructions (no vents, wires, debris, or protrusions) and no people present. There is no obvious slope or fragility indicatedâ€”just consistent textureâ€”so it meets the criteria for a safe landing spot.",
""" The surface appears to be a large, flat rooftop deck with uniform concrete slabs and no visible slope.
- The central area is clear of obstructions: no HVAC units, vents, ducts, debris, vehicles, or cables are visible within the landing zone.
- No people are present on the surface.
- Parapet walls exist only at the perimeter and do not obstruct a landing if you touch down near the center; they also provide wind shielding. Avoid the edges during approach.
Conclusion: This surface meets the criteria (flat, clear, no people) and is suitable for a final approach, targeting the central open area away from the parapet edges.""",
"Assessment: The surface appears to be a flat expanse of rectangular concrete/stone tiles. I see no people, no obstructions (no vents, railings, debris, or protrusions), and the tile joints look even without large gaps or height differences. The area looks level with no evident slope. Texture and faint shadows do not indicate hazards. This meets the criteria for a safe landing zone. Proceed with a careful, vertical final approach.",
"The surface is a flat rooftop with ample open area around the marked spot. I see no visible obstructions such as HVAC units, vents, cables, or debris near the landing point, and there are no people present. The landing point is well away from the edges/parapet, reducing edge risk. Shadows and color variations donâ€™t indicate actual hazards. This appears suitable for a final approach.",
""" The selected area appears to be a large, flat roof surface made of broad slabs. The tiles show seams but no height changes indicating obstacles.
- No visible obstructions near the green marker (no vents, ducts, rails, wires, or debris). The closest edge/parapet is off to the left and the chosen spot is well away from it, leaving a safe buffer.
- No people are present on the surface.
- The surface looks level and uniform; texture and color variations do not indicate hazards.
Conclusion: This is a suitable site for a final approach and emergency landing.""",
"The rooftop appears flat and level, with a large, open central area. There are no people visible. The only obstructions are a few rooftop vents located near the bottom edge of the roof; the marked landing spot (green square) is well away from these and from the roof edges, providing a clear buffer. Given the clear, flat surface and separation from obstructions, this site is suitable for a final approach, targeting the marked center area while avoiding the vents and edges.",
"Assessment: The surface appears to be flat, even, and uniformly tiled. There are no visible obstructions such as ducts, debris, cables, vehicles, or protrusions. No people are present. The tile seams and texture do not indicate hazards and should not affect landing. Overall, it meets the requirements for a safe landing. Note: As always, confirm adequate clearance beyond the camera frame and avoid edges or sudden drops nearby during final approach.",
"Assessment: The rooftop interior appears flat and level, with a parapet only at the perimeter. The central area (green marker) is clear of visible obstructions such as HVAC units, ducts, antennas, vehicles, or rubble. No people are present. Shadows across the surface do not indicate physical obstacles. Therefore, the central zone provides a clear, flat, and obstructionâ€‘free area for a safe emergency landing. Recommendation: Proceed with a vertical approach to the green-marked center, staying well clear of the parapet edges.",
"The surface appears to be a uniform, granular, shingle-like plane with no visible objects protruding (no vents, ducts, debris, wires, or vehicles) and no people present. The texture and grid do not indicate hazards, and the visible dark shapes are shadows rather than physical obstacles. There is no clear evidence of slope or fragility in this close-up. Given these observations, this spot is suitable for a final approach.",
""" The central rectangular area appears to be a large, flat concrete surface (likely a rooftop deck or plaza). The surface shows straight expansion joints and consistent texture, with no visible slope.
- It is clear of obstructions: no HVAC units, vents, rails, cars, debris, or cables are visible on the landing zone.
- It is clear of people: no pedestrians are present on the surface itself. Nearby streets have vehicles, but they are outside the landing area.
- Edges are bounded by parapet/curb, but there is ample open space to land well away from edges. Shadows do not indicate obstacles.
Conclusion: Suitable for final approach. Aim for the center of the open concrete area and be mindful of potential wind turbulence from surrounding buildings during descent.""",
""" The surface appears to be a flat, paved/tiled area with consistent, level lines and no visible slope.
- No obstructions are visible (no vents, rails, debris, or protrusions). The small green marker is not an obstruction.
- No people are present in the frame.
- The diagonal darker region is a shadow, not a physical obstacle.
Conclusion: Meets the criteria (clear of obstructions and people, flat). Safe for final approach.""",
"The surface is a flat rooftop and no people are visible, but there are multiple obstructions (rooftop units/vents) spread across the area, including near the center. This violates the requirement that the landing site be clear of obstructions and leaves limited margin for a safe descent. Recommend searching for a larger unobstructed area.",
"""The surface is a flat rooftop enclosed by a parapet. I see no people present. There are several rooftop fixtures/vents, but there are also sizeable clear areas of flat gravel where the drone can land. Choosing an open patch a few meters away from the vents and away from the parapet edges satisfies the requirements: flat, people-free, and with a clear landing spot.
Proceed with a careful final approach targeting one of the unobstructed areas.""",
"""Surface condition: the marked spot is on a flat plaza-like ground with No visible slope. Minor texture variations donâ€™t indicate hazards.
- Obstructions: immediate area around the marker is clear. Nearby benches, planters, and lamp posts are Several meters away and wonâ€™t interfere with a vertical descent.
- people: None visible in the vicinity.
- Overall: Meets the requirementsâ€”clear, flat, and free of people. Proceed with a careful vertical approach while keeping clearance from the benches and lamp posts.""",
"Assessment: The surface appears to be a flat rooftop area with uniform tiling and no visible slope. The interior section is clear of obstructions (no vents, ducts, equipment, or debris) and there are no people present. The only nearby hazards are the parapet walls around the perimeter; these are stationary obstacles but do not encroach on the central landing area. Recommendation: Proceed with a final approach, targeting the central zone and maintaining a vertical descent to avoid the parapet edges, keeping rotor wash away from the walls.",
"Not suitable for final approach. The marked spot is in an active traffic lane on a roadway. There are vehicles nearby, making the area not clear of obstructions and posing collision risk. Although the road appears generally flat, it is not clear of traffic/obstacles and is near roadway edges/structures, which further increases risk. Choose a clear, open, stationary surface instead (e.g., a wide empty area away from cars).",
"Assessment: The central elevated roadway appears to be a broad, flat asphalt surface with clear lane space and no visible cars, debris, or air ducts on the landing area. No people are visible. Compared with the adjacent parking lot (densely packed with vehicles = obstructions), the roadway offers the lowest-risk option. Cautions: there are guardrails/edges alongside the road, so maintain a stabilized, centered approach and minimize lateral drift; verify no approaching traffic before touchdown. Conclusion: Meets the must-have criteria (flat, clear of obstructions and people) and is the safest available option here, so final approach can proceed.",
"The highlighted spot is on an active roadway. While the asphalt appears flat and the immediate patch is free of debris and people, it is adjacent to parked vehicles and a curb/guardrail, and vehicles could enter the lane unexpectedly. The proximity to cars and potential traffic makes it an unsafe final landing area compared to safer isolated surfaces (e.g., empty rooftop or vacant parking lot). Cancel the approach here.",
"Not safe for final approach. The marked spot is in an active traffic lane on a roadway. There are vehicles present and moving nearby, which are obstructions and indicate nearby people. Traffic can enter the area unpredictably, making it impossible to ensure a clear, stable landing zone. Although the asphalt is flat, the site fails the requirements of being clear of obstructions and people.",
"The highlighted area is on a wide, flat roadway. The surface appears level with no visible debris or protrusions near the target. There are no people in the landing zone. Parked cars and the curb/guardrail are off to the right but not within the immediate touchdown area, leaving adequate clearance if you stay centered between lane markings. Visually, this meets the criteria for a clear, flat surface, though remain vigilant for any approaching vehicles during descent."
